# About MXFramework
MXFramework is an open source project developed and maintained by [Henry Li](#about-me) (a.k.a. MagicCube).
The project was firstly introduced in 2006 when Henry started his internship in [State Grid Corporation of China](http://www.sgcc.com.cn/ywlm/index.shtml).

## MWFramework <small>started in 2006</small>
The first version which named MWFramework was designed to be a stand-alone rich web client library like Sencha Ext JS, and only support IE.
In the middle of 2012, it is said there were over 1,000 developers in [State Grid Corporation of China (SGCC)](http://www.sgcc.com.cn/ywlm/index.shtml) used MWFramework to develop enterprise web applications.
[SGCC](http://www.sgcc.com.cn/ywlm/index.shtml) is one of the largest company in China and even in the world.

## MXFramework 2 <small>started in 2012</small>
In version 2, it changed its name to MXFramework. Most of framework codes were refactored, and it finally supported most of the modern browsers using jQuery.
A JavaScript compressor along with document generator was introduced in this version. 

## MXFramework 3 <small>open source on GitHub in 2014</small>
In the third version which is the latest, the totally redesigned MXFramework is now aiming to be a simple, lightweight, modularized, Object-Oriented JavaScript framework.
MXFramework 3 gives up all its UI libraries and uncommonly used utilities, and brings the developers an all-in-one Eclipse plugin including a brand new module-based compiler.

> *No more limitations from the pre-defined UI controls and built-in themes, developers can now design, fast-prototype and implement their ideas from the beginning.*
> *Meanwhile, components and libraries can be refined and shared just as easy as before.* - **Henry Li**
